The help file is a combined help file "GoAsm.chm".  If you find that
you cannot open this, it may be that the file is blocked for security
reasons by the system.  Try right clicking the file and unblocking it
in "properties".

If you have an early version of Windows, you won't be able to read  
GoAsm.chm without the latest version of help.  You can get this by 
running the Microsoft self-executing file Hhupd.exe.  This is 
available from www.microsoft.com.
In that site just enter Hhupd.exe as a search line.
If you still have trouble please e-mail me on jg@jgnet.co.uk.
